                    Hey, we get it; the web is cluttered with ads, tracking cookies, useless cruft we don't
                    need, and it's slowing us down. So it's totally understandable why you have JavaScript
                    disabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that said, this site is a demonstration of how various JavaScript APIs
                    such as <var>ServiceWorker</var> and <a href="https://skatejs.github.io">Skate.js</a>
                    can help to make the web faster. These technologies require JavaScript in order to run.
                    You'll not see much more than this message without it.
